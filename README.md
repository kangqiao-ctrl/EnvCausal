# EnvCausal
A Causal Inference Framework for Environmental Data Analysis

This repository contains all the necessary data and custom Python scripts to reproduce the results in the paper "Machine Learningâ€“Aided Causal Inference Framework for Environmental Data Analysis: A COVID-19 Case Study".

Jupyter Notebook examples will be uploaded in future releases.

## Install
`pip install EnvCausal`

## Script descriptions
  _clustering.py_ -- A PCA-then-k-means clustering pipeline.</br>
  _causal_estimate.py_ -- A dowhy package wrapper, results will be written in a txt file<sup>1</sup>. </br>
  _recover_network.py_ -- A SAM model for Bayesian network recovery, adjacent matrix will be returned.  </br>
  _result_plot.py_ -- A couple of functions for result visualization.</br>

<sup>1</sup>Inspired by [Dowhy example: Iterating over multiple refutation tests](https://github.com/microsoft/dowhy/blob/master/docs/source/example_notebooks/dowhy_refuter_notebook.ipynb)</br>
